# Tech Talks!
I love giving talks at meetups and conferences about things that I've learned. Here are a few talks that I've given, as well as a few that I'm working on:

- [Goodbye REST: Building GraphQL APIs with Django](https://github.com/jaydenwindle/talks/blob/master/django-graphql.md)
- Building Real-time Apps with React
