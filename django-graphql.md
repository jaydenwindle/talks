# Goodbye REST - Building APIs with Django and GraphQL

### Abstract
We recently migrated the Jetpack API from REST to GraphQL. In this talk I discuss some of the 
reasons that GraphQL is a good fit for us, as well as some of it's drawbacks. We also take a look at how
to create a GraphQL API using Django and the Graphene framework. Finally, we look at what the future holds
for Django and GraphQL.
